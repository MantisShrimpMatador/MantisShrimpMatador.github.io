		<p id="C0S1P1" class="content">“The Earth is nothing but the void embodied in dirt. Life is nothing more than taking a long walk off a circular pier. We don’t die in ivory graves; we don't die under the sacred blessings of the stars. When we finally hit our limits, our thinning skin just gives way so we can be expulsed from ourselves, into raw bloodied meaty piles of ourselves, carelessly a’splatter. I have seen it firsthand; It was I whom conducted that train.” The miasmic old coot stated emphatically as he stared at an imaginary audience, beyond the shoulders of a real audience consisting of some mesmerized high school skater punks. They were listening to his every word with morbid fascination. His eyes were piercing; his stare cut through the night sky as if it were penetrating the curtain of the cosmos, and straight into the eyes of God. It was a very dark and stormy night the night before; he had no shelter from the rain. He was still wet at that point, it didn’t help his condition much. The urban inlet was stained various shades of dingy brown, as was his clothing and his flesh. The kids were dressed in speckless dayglo nineteen eighties inspired nostalgic colors their middle class parents purchased for them. Whether or not he was aware of his improper use of the word ‘whom’ was hardly moot. The teenagers were enraptured by his grandiose rantings. Ones of which he’d divulge to anybody whom was close enough to be ensnared.</p>
		
		
		<p id="C0S1P2" class="content">“I was the best damn train conductor in the goddamn world! Until that night, my record was spotless. I was laying down tracks when I was in my crib. Every single picture they took of me in gradeschool had me with my lucky blue conductor’s hat. It started with me putting it on; in the middle it had the teachers asking me to take it off, which made me cry; and in the end, it had me bringing in a note from my psychiatrist stating I needed the hat in order to be psychologically well. I was born for this, and only this, and I knew it. When I grew up, my wife was a train attendant. My mentor and best friend was the CEO of Amtrak, even though I never met him in person. I had the script for every single travel point burnt into the back of my eyelids. I even practiced picking up the intercom in the most time efficient tastefully dramatic manner, even though I knew I would have only been seen by my coworkers. That was until one night, when an unholy angel flittered into the corner of my eye. I saw a flash, the tracks bent, it was at a grim mountain's edge. There were flames so high I thought they were burning the clouds out of the sky. There were charred and eviscerated bodies in piles beside me. I was the unlucky son of a bitch who survived! That was the end of all of my dreams.</p>
		
		<p id="C0S1P3" class="content">After that, I couldn’t stop contemplating suicide. But every single time I thought of it, I’d always hear the sound of steel wheels over rails, and I’d fall into a trance. I’d wake up still without any will to live, yet I had even less the will to die. My wife left me before we could have kids. I will never have a legacy. I lost my house, I lost my reputation, I lost everything! Seems I had put all my eggs in that one damn basket… Then kicked the fucking thing overboard! I watched the bubbling yokes pouring up to the surface of the oily muck of this shit-swamp! I had nothing left but to cry as they sizzled. I can’t do anything at this point. I have no religion. I have no hobbies. I have no interests. All I can do is drink. Fuck, that’s only when I don't have any tar! You see me lie in the alleyway here, kid, you should realize that’s all there is to life. Entropy is nothing but a fancy term for rotting.” The ex-conductor said right before passing out onto asphalt. They assumed this was the happiest moment of his existence. That was until he began snoring, making it a tie for maybe his second or third. It doesn’t matter, though, he’ll fall flat face in his own vomit one day and never know the difference. Then, he’ll be pulling the whistle’s chain on Heaven’s train. At least, that’s what they have to tell themselves...</p>

		<p id="C0S2P1" class="content">To be laughed at is not the worst thing that ‘Cobraman’ Studcutt Johnson has ever had to deal with. Even being laughed at by feathers is tolerable. However, being laughed at by those feathers staring from a streak of light pointing outward from his closet, and having it paralyze him with terror, is the worst thing that could ever be endured. From the exit curtain, he heard the animal screams of thousands of thirsting, starving, near lunatic frenzied women. They paid their tickets that night. They would have likely rioted if they don’t get 'The Stud'. He should have been happy, his stage was set. He was in top shape. He was doing aerobics for five hours a day for five weeks prior. He had practiced every move on tape, and poured over every minute mistake, emotionally flagellating himself until they no longer happened. He did this night after night – depriving himself of sleep, greatly shortening his life. His whole body had to be utilized perfectly. Like a great stage actor, he knew that every inch of him was to be exposed, from his little right toe to his stonecut nose, and he prepared himself; physically, mentally, and spiritually. After all, he was not just a stripper – he was THEE stripper.</p>
		
		<p id="C0S2P2" class="content">He was the first male stripper in all of history to sell out an auditorium; not for a rebranding, not for a cameo, not even for a sleazy tell-all – but to dance, and only dance. He was a trailblazer here. He was doing something no man had done before, and very few, if any, would probably since. Sure, he was in his forties now, but he looked twenty years younger. Most importantly, he still loved his craft. However, without his boa he was nothing. He was monikered the ‘Cobraman’ for a reason – his best moves were impossible without it. It was his trademark, it was more him than him. His dad was a professional snake handler, he was around snakes his whole life. It was a selling point. Since it was a legal liability for him to bring a real snake on the stage, he brought one of feather. His dad initially disapproved, disowned him, sent him on his own, but he became a regional superstar in the greater Detroit area. That was until the crash. However, he was rediscovered many years later as a cult icon through the internet. A ‘Where Are They Now’ documentary had launched him into superstardom. This was his chance to return to the limelight. Hell, an even bigger limelight than he had ever known – something he loved every second of. He had a contract for four and a half million dollars to do a tour. This was his first stop, Madison Square Garden. He wanted to go solo, yet the feather boa was so essential that it was bound into his contract. Meaning, neither the money nor the fame was possible without the boa.</p>
		
		<p id="C0S2P3" class="content">Flashback a bit to the moment after Studdcutt’s retirement, he needed to make money somehow. He came back to his father with his hat in hand (well, not literally, no exotic dancer worth his salt takes his hat off without throwing it into a pulsing crowd). He expected a stern ‘no’. He got more of a stern ‘yes’. His father begrudgingly put him through retraining to take on the legacy of being a great snake handler. He sold his father the merits of showbiz. He convinced him to do a father/son act (of course, carnival snake handling. No sexiness – nothing THAT weird),  they were opening for a major Vegas magician (in a Baton Rouge high school gym, but still…). Leading up to it he and his father bonded more than ever. They let all the bye-gones be bye-gones.  They even learned to love each other again. The very first show, however, a reticulated python had wrapped around his father’s neck and strangled him from red to purple to blue to death black. This was because his father was distracted at Studcutt’s mishandling of a king cobra, and tried to give him instructions midshow while handling an even bigger snake.</p>
		
		<p id="C0S2P4" class="content">After this happened, Studcutt was also distracted, and the cobra bit into Studcutt’s (Real Name: Norman’s) jugular sending the venom straight into his bloodstream. They had plenty of anti-toxins at hand and barely saved him. Yet he experienced a near-death vision of being wrapped into serpent skin tighter and tighter and trying to scream but being too constricted as the scales began to tear through his flesh and seep into his pores until there was nothing left to him but oblivious black. Now, he has PTSD. Every single time he sees his trademark feather boa (Real Name: Buffroast Steakworm) in full light he lapses into waking nightmares of it wrapping around his skin, in a million knots, and dragging him through the floor all the way to Hell. Back to the curtain call, his glance is traded between the cone of light from his closet and the cone of light from the exit. The clock is ticking…</p>

		<p id="C0S3P1" class="content">Convergence Point, where Fate Dr. meets Cataclysm Ave; 6756 Fate Dr. At this spot there’s a building that appears to be constructed entirely of green fiberglass. You have to be standing on a roof five blocks away to see the top of it, and only on a clear day. On an unclear day, the clouds seem to move more slowly, but only if it is in your eye’s reflection. At all hours, through each wall, brilliant light shines out, only dampened by layers of built up condensation and mist. All shapes inside appear as silhouettes. This is the world’s largest plant genetics laboratory. The ribbon cutting ceremony is happening soon, making it still unborne. Beneath the stacks of hexagonal greenhouses, is a complex of plasticine basements full of overly sanitized corridors. Each of the basement floors are concealed past a labyrinth of keycards so convoluted it takes portable software to correctly decipher which is needed. The spiral, screw-like, structure above ground, with intertwined circular transparent elevator tubes twisted around it, is open to the public. Access to the basements is increasingly exclusive the deeper they go. Until they hit bedrock and possibly, with technological advances, sub-bedrock. Only those in the know, know. More on that later.</p>

		<p id="C0S4P1" class="content">Her ten o’clock was with Dr. Raymond Gregtunt. Her twelve o'clock was with Mariana Markylough. She had three appointments after that - a light day. What Barbara Daisy learned in her old age is that you have nothing left to do with your life, but to be carted from specialist to specialist. She was falling apart as the doctors were struggling, tallying tens of thousands of dollars of unpayable debt (which inevitably they will have to hire debt collectors and law firms to harass her children after she dies for, until they can be bled of every last cent). Just so she could live a life of nothing but being confused, in the dark, and miserable. She lived in an assisted living facility and arrived home every night too exhausted to want to move. They had a little clubhouse congress there that decided nothing. She was head of the furniture arrangement committee. It was the only freedom she had. Her daughter came over constantly, but only to hammer her routine into her. To make sure she took her twenty five weekly pills. She couldn’t see well, and she couldn’t walk without a walker. The coloration of her room was soft beige, and the lighting was dim. So she was living like a shrew. She could only detect where she was by feeling the warmth of the air around her. Not that she had anywhere to go, anyway. She would just crawl to her bed and take twenty five minutes to get under the covers. She would then turn on the television, the only thing that glowed in her room. It made her feel as if there as some life left for her. It was showing gameshows – always gameshows – The Gameshow Network. She didn’t really follow what was going on with it, yet it was her favorite thing. It was nice, it was ambient, it was comforting. She would fall asleep to it and she’d dream in colors. Not in images, not in ideas, not in sounds, but just colors. Music, though; vast, complex, yet accessible symphonies of pigments. She loved these so much she hoped that they were all that heaven was when she finally didn’t awaken.</p>

		<p id="C0S5P1" class="content">Studcutt Johnson escaped with his life (debatable). He somehow mustered the courage to bring the boa on stage – an hour and a half late. The women who haven’t thrown their chairs and/or were dragged out screaming were standing with their arms crossed. Even if he had given a perfect performance, it would have likely not done any good at that point. He lost the courage to handle his boa midway through. He ended up facing the disenfranchised stares of the sobering mob. A few fervid fanatics tried to ignite some sense of enthusiasm, but it was a loss. He collapsed a few seconds after unveiling his feather boa. He folded, drooling, into fetal pose – nearly shoving his thumb in his mouth, to literally suck on, before snapping into reality. He was still drooling as he pulled himself up. The mucusy saliva seeped into his hair - scuffing it grotesquely. The riot began – he needed a police escort out. He somehow, miraculously, made it with only scratches and bitemarks. He was barely even bleeding. After that fiasco, he decided suicide was the only option.</p>
		
		<p id="C0S5P2" class="content">From there on out, he only wore black. He also concealed as much of himself as he could. He wore baggy pants, a fedora, sunglasses, shined army boots, and a overcoat. He let his beard take over his face. He couldn’t inflict pain on himself or stand the tedium of tying his own knot. He decided, due to his cold feet, that the only way to effectively kill himself was to put him into a situation where he was 100% sure that he’d die, even if he changed his mind. So he drove to the heart of the Rocky Mountains in the middle of the night. They appeared to just be black piles of ash over a pure orange gradient slowly dimming into dark purple. With the tips of his fingers, and the handle of a black bag in his mouth, he used his fleeting energy to claw his way up the cold dirt and rock; bending his fingers back, grinding the tips to nubs, staining his skin, draining his body of sweat. He did not slip once, even without mountain gear. His focused determination to die put him in a zen mind to where he could not afford to make a mistake that would kill him.</p>
		
		<p id="C0S5P3" class="content">He got to a thin, barely railed, strip of train tracks. He took off his shoes to feel it. The wood planks were fragile under his arches. He could hear them crack under his weight. They were dry as tinder, but yet they had been dampened and worn by the rain before. The night was cool, he saw his breath, his chest moved very slowly, very efficiently, determined not to waste what little oxygen was left at this elevation. He marched with perfect tempo, not a single moment of hesitation. He was walking the opposite way the Amtrak was heading. He made sure to pick a path sloping upward, to make it impossible for him to climb back down. The night was pure black when he got to that point. The trees could not be seen, and only slightly heard, but he felt them in the wind.  No matter how far he got up the mountain, no matter how little life could sustain, he felt like he was falling deeper into the forestry. His breath thinned and his muscles felt heavier. He was moving just as he was, with perfect tempo, but he was beginning to feel himself stretch in the wind. There was a resistance to him. Something ghastly. Something… intangible. Like the will of fate weighing down on him. Not tearing him but pulling him back. The moon has faded long ago.</p>
		
		<p id="C0S5P4" class="content">A board snapped beneath his foot, and he tripped, slamming down knee first into rusted iron. It tore his pants and split his leg open. He struggled to rise to his feet, even with his zealotry to march, with great difficulty. He limped further into the night. Through the recoils of numbness in his steps he imagined the feeling of all death beneath him under the entire crust of the Earth. As if these railings are on top the world’s graveyard. He couldn’t feel himself losing energy but he knew he was. He feared passing out and not savoring that final moment, as he felt he needed to. He finally buckled to his knees. He threw away all excesses and mementos. He felt he only needed himself in another life. All is discarded except one thing he was carrying in his black bag. The one he cannot look at, but he can feel. He tossed the rest away limping forward. His bleakest moment was brightened as he heard the sounds of sirens and an engine. He saw a singular light… It came closer… closer… He anticipated the final moment, calculated it perfectly. He began to dance.</p>
		
		<p id="C0S5P5" class="content">He tantalizingly began to remove every article of clothing in the frigid night, feeling the brisk night air sterilize his immaculate body. He raised the boa into the sky like Thor’s hammer and, somehow, magically, lightning struck behind him. This did not empower him but startled him, making him release the boa into the wind which flew into the window of the train. This spooked the conductor who had a jerk reaction sending the train off the rails into a calamity of sparks. It peeled off of the side of the mountain pass, bending the gate, and grazing the air before Studcutt. The entire train passed in front of him close enough for him to feel the heat of the engine permeating, but not enough to physically touch him – let alone kill him. Hundreds of bodies piled out of the cars as they tumbled over the side of the railing. The engine ignited on it’s crashing. It revealed people as shadows falling into the flames. He heard them scream as they exploded into their own agonies. He looked over the edge to where the piles of bodies, appearing small as ants, were entangled in themselves and charring away. He dropped to his knees and slammed his head against the wood, in humiliated defeat, until he passed out. He did not die, though. That’s yet another step...</p>
