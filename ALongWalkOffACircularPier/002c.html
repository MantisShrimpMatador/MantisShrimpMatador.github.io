		<p id="C2S1P1" class="content">Sgt. Richard Face of the Stone Prairie, Illinois Police Department gently tucked a full-cuffed near-naked (wrapped in a towel to cover his genitals, not his choice) man coated in his feces (his own, not Face’s) into the back of his squadcar. Face was the reformist of the force. It took five men to capture the perp down Main Street (Like a silent film slapstick skit. The only thing missing was them running around with giant butterfly nets). Face was the only one who didn’t want to beat him, he had to shield his eyes when the hoses came out. I guess you could say he was the ‘good cop’ in this ‘interrogation’ process. Face slammed the door shut and fob’d the car into lock (From the inside, risking setting off the burglary alarm next time it would open. An occurrence that has gotten him written up more than once). He then pulled the car into reverse to exit the parking spot. “So, buddy, you’re from the city?” Face kindly asked, and got evil eye’d through the rear view mirror. “Honestly bro, I didn’t even want to take you in. I’d rather drop you off at rehab. You’ve got to stop the tweaking, it definitely pollutes your decision making process.” </p>
		
		<p id="C2S1P2" class="content">The near-naked dude had a greased black beard with white strands, greased white hair with black strands. Some of his natural black pigment was left combined with smidgens of fake dye of a clearly distinguishable color from his nature. His body was not muscular. He had rolls of blubber that would bulge out at some angles and not at others. They were hidden in pockets within the thin skin that made him look like he was pulled straight from a famine state. His body was cut, torn, scratched, and burnt all over (even before the chase).  He huffed hard under the scarlet taint of his busted forehead. “So, what happens in the big city when they see a bucknaked man covered in his own poop?” Face asked with a sincere, oddly friendly, laugh. Trying to lighten up the situation. The car has already merged onto the street.</p>
		
		<p id="C2S1P3" class="content">“In Chi-town? The pigs either laugh their asses off or shoot you on sight.” Responded the near-naked man which halted Face’s laugher and started his own. The near-naked man was uncomfortably hysterical. Only ceasing when he started hacking up flemmy blood. When he’s done painting the carpeted floor he states. “Even when you’re not naked or covered in shit!”</p>
		
		<p id="C2S1P4" class="content">“Don’t get that all over the car!” Face yelled faintly while flashing the ‘criminal’ a stern face. “...I’m kidding, It’s my car. I can clean up whatever. Trust me, I have to.” Face said, stopped at a traffic light. He sniffed the air, the stench made him actually regret that part of the job. He found cleaning a meditative experience… well, usually. “So, lets lighten up the topic. What do you do for fun there, buddy?”</p>
		
		<p id="C2S1P5" class="content">“Oh, the regular thing, Officer. Get stoned, piss in the alley, puke all over myself while being thrown out of strip clubs… the usual.” The man said bearing a sardonic grin.</p>
		
		<p id="C2S1P6" class="content">“Strip clubs? Oh, we don’t have many of those out here.”</p>
		
		<p id="C2S1P7" class="content">“Yeah, well, Chicago has plenty. What’s it to you?”</p>
		
		<p id="C2S1P8" class="content">“What are they like?”</p>
		
		<p id="C2S1P9" class="content">“You’ve never been to a strip club… What kind of cop doesn’t go strip clubbing?”</p>	
		
		<p id="C2S1P10" class="content">“Small town cops, friend. This is Mayberry, remember.”</p>
		
		<p id="C2S1P11" class="content">“Yeah, well, naked women dance and you throw money at them… What’s there for you to know?”</p>
		
		<p id="C2S1P12" class="content">“I don’t get it… What’s the appeal?”</p>
		
		<p id="C2S1P13" class="content">“That they’re naked… What do you think, dumbass!”</p>
		
		<p id="C2S1P14" class="content">“Hey… hey… no reason to be hostile. Just having a conversation here... What’s your favorite?”</p>
	
		<p id="C2S1P15" class="content">“Favorite what?”</p>
		
		<p id="C2S1P16" class="content">“Strip Club, in Chicago, what’s your favorite strip club in Chicago?”</p>
		
		<p id="C2S1P17" class="content">“The Mobius Club.”</p>
		
		<p id="C2S1P18" class="content">“The Mol-dee-us club?”</p>
		
		<p id="C2S1P19" class="content">“Yeah, the Mobius club. You know, how most strip clubs have a stage, right?” The Shit-Covered Man said to Face, Face nodded. “Well, you see, you’re supposed to throw money at the stage. But, at most stripclubs the stage only has an outside. The Mobius Club has a stage with an outside AND an inside. You need to throw the money from the inside only. The problem is, however, it is impossible to escape once you enter. So, you’ve got dudes trying to pay the girls their bit, and they just end up trapped in there for the rest of their life.”</p>
		
		<p id="C2S1P20" class="content">“That’s a terrible business idea. How would they make any money?”</p>
		
		<p id="C2S1P21" class="content">“Skeletons.”</p>
		
		<p id="C2S1P22" class="content">“Skeletons?”</p>
		
		<p id="C2S1P23" class="content">“Yes, it’s upstairs to a goth gogo bar owned by the same people. The strippers trap the men in. The men eventually starve to death trying to find their way out and, when the bacteria picks them bone clean, a trap door is activated and they end up in the club below. Their skeletons are thrown into elevated cages as atmosphere to that moody industrial music they dance to. The strippers get paid per skeleton they lure.”</p>
		
		<p id="C2S1P24" class="content">“Man, I don’t know how you folks could ever tolerate living in the city, it’s a scary place…” Face pulls into police HQ parking.</p>
		
		<p id="C2S1" class="sectionend">~</p>
		
		<p id="C2S2P1" class="content">Remember when the world was clean? The conductor did – it was for him then, when he wore his pressed blue uniform. He found himself at a bar on the corner of Chicago Union Station, he ordered a “Milk, Skim.” The bartender giggled. Not only because this was what he ordered every time he came, but because he was a full grown man. The conductor has never touched a hard drink in his life, up to that point. He would do nothing that inhibited his ability to focus on his work. Of course, for that very reason, he downed some legal amphetamines here and there, but only to the recommendations of his humble old doctor (ie. to the recommendations of the pharmaceutical company paying his doctor under the table), and only to keep himself sharp. I mean, how else do you do back to back thirteen hour train drives? Honorably, he never lost count of his MGs. The bar was homey, a kind of an old(-burnt-out-)male hideout, the kind of place where you could read a newspaper, or watch sports coverage on low volume. </p>
		
		<p id="C2S2P2" class="content">In fact, beside him was a man with aviation-goggle-style reading glasses with red rims, a peppered gray mustache, and a page opened to stock market figures. A couple of surprisingly sober frat boys are quietly playing pool in the background. No sharking, that’s how you can tell it’s early in the day. The bartender brought him his milk. It’s 76% water – AFTER skimming; The conductor didn’t know the difference. Funny thing about the conductor is that he has traveled everywhere the country has to offer and has never taken in any flavor of any kind. He could remember word for word every single factoid needed to enhance the experience of his passengers, but lacked any semblance of context. Context is important. In fact, context is so important that it is the only way to cope with the truly unpredictable. Like, when you are in a half empty bar in the middle of daytime and a ninja walks in.</p>
		
		<p id="C2S2P3" class="content">Yes, a fully clad, facially masked, ninja in white; with nunchucks, some shuriken, a bow, blow darts, wrapped feet, a red bandana, the works. The ninja sits at the bar beside the conductor, and gives the barkeep a gesture. The barkeep nods indicating familiarity. Of course, the conductor has no context so he practically jolts out of his seat when this happens. “Friend, don’t worry about it.” The ninja said easing the conductor. “We used to know each other a long time ago.”</p>
		
		<p id="C2S2P4" class="content">“A long time ago? Did we go to school together?”</p>
		
		<p id="C2S2P5" class="content">“I can’t say, but I was a different person then. That was before I learned who I was. I remember your name.”</p>
		
		<p id="C2S2P6" class="content">“What is it?”</p>
		
		<p id="C2S2P7" class="content">“Brady Royce.” The ninja said stunning the conductor. Yes, that was his name. I should have dropped it in earlier. I mean, to let you know the name before you know the character, so you can familiarize yourself, and know who I’m talking about when I’m writing. Terrible tick of mine, proves I’m a horribly disorganized author. Fuck, I said no more fourth wall breaking… apologies. I promise it will stop from now on. “The nostalgia of meeting you again brightens up my day.”</p>
		
		<p id="C2S2P8" class="content">“Have you had a bad day?”</p>
		
		<p id="C2S2P9" class="content">“I’ve had a bad life.” The ninja said right before being delivered his fermented fish heads in vodka. 113 proof. He has to angle his straw past his face-cover to sip. It’s a struggle, but he succeeds with ninja skill. Establishing his credibility. “Ah… I needed that. You don’t drink anymore, Brady?”</p>
		
		<p id="C2S2P10" class="content">“I never have drank.” Brady said sipping his milk. “I don’t imagine I ever will.”</p>
		
		<p id="C2S2P11" class="content">“Oh yes, now I remember. It inhibited your ability to guide the train. Don’t say never, though. Fate delivers strange gifts, my friend. Sometimes cruel gifts. It’s not about avoiding them, you can’t… It’s about adjusting to them.”</p>
		
		<p id="C2S2P12" class="content">“Have you ever had a strange gift? A cruel gift?”</p>
		
		<p id="C2S2P13" class="content">“I’ve lost somebody close to me...” The ninja sheds a tear which spills over his face-guard. It rolls down into his drink. “...Something like a wife, yet something… more...”</p>
		
		<p id="C2S2P14" class="content">“Family? Best Friend?”</p>
		
		<p id="C2S2P15" class="content">“No, something more than that… Something that can only be compared to the loss of God. The loss of purpose in life. I can’t even lift a fist anymore yet alone be the defender of justice.”</p>
		
		<p id="C2S2P16" class="content">“Look, I haven’t had much loss in my life. Yet, if I had, I’d probably handle it better than you are. This is self destruction!” Brady took the last sip of his milk and requested a napkin with a hand gesture, after near ruining his uniform by wiping off his milk ‘stache with his sleeve. “Trust me, I’m well prepared for anything.”</p>
		
		<p id="C2S2P17" class="content">“I’ve learned just recently; you think you can be prepared for anything, but you can’t be prepared for everything.”</p>
		
		<p id="C2S2P18" class="content">“What are you doing here? This bar is mostly for train personnel and passengers. Do you have a train to hop?”</p>
		
		<p id="C2S2P19" class="content">“No, this is where I go to mourn. It happened here.”</p>
		
		<p id="C2S2P20" class="content">“What happened?”</p>
		
		<p id="C2S2P21" class="content">“My cruel gift...” </p>
		
		<p id="C2S2P22" class="content">The ninja sucks down the last of his drink. So quickly it burns his stomach. He orders another. “...Are you going to be sticking around town for long, Brady?”</p>
		
		<p id="C2S2P23" class="content">“Sorry, but…” Brady then looked at his watch. “...my next train is leaving in fifteen minutes. Say, before I go, I hadn’t caught your name.”</p>
		
		<p id="C2S2P24" class="content">“I don’t have a name but I have an essence… I am ‘The White Ninja’. The one and only, my friend… probably the last.”</p>
		
		<p id="C2S2P25" class="content">“There’s never a last to anything, Mr. Ninja.”</p>
		
		<p id="C2S2P26" class="content">“Oh yes there is, there will definitely be one last man alive. Just so he can make that final choice.” The White Ninja closed his eyes. The wheels were already a’chuggin’ in Brady’s head. His mind is at the next destination point. The White Ninja finalizes “If God, whatever it is, is kind, he’ll pick the right man.”</p>

		<p id="C2S3P1" class="content">Rich Face was driving back from his last patrol of the night. Today, he had the anecdote of the year, he thought: the big city slicker swinging upside-down on a traffic light, naked, tweaked out of his mind, curling fresh defecations onto the streets below. The prosecution was going to be difficult, trying to pinpoint the ‘why’. The defense was going to be a nightmare. It inevitably would become a fiasco that populates the front page news for weeks to come, probably. He had already spoken to the two crime scene reporters working at the Stone Prairie International Herald (one of them a part time Sports Analyst, the other sometimes contributed to the antique section of the Classifieds. The Classifieds took up half the paper – three pages. So, the big wigs). It was like lighting striking the pin of an needle fifteen feet underground. Stone Prairie was kind of just constructed of short green grass and light pink painted houses. Even the skies were mundane. It was slightly dark and cloudy when it rained, and it was light blue with white swirls when it was warm. It snowed quite a bit in the winter, and the cars had always driven slow, but it’s not like people were endangering their lives to traverse their way to the mom’n’pop deli at the corner. Face then stopped by an old man by the ol’ parking meter.</p>
		
		<p id="C2S3P2" class="content">Yes, the town had an entire parking meter. It was a remnant from a mayor thrice before who poured the entire town’s budget into trying to transform it into a hip getaway. Two problems: it was too far from Chicago, and it wasn’t Chicago. So, he was soon impeached by the fifteen person town council and was replaced with a cold hard fiscal libertarian. The Cold Hard Fiscal Libertarian just pocketed fifteen percent of the tax income, and threw the rest at the town’s most profitable building contractor. He was told he could work on whatever projects he deemed fit. Currently the contractor is working, on and off, on a  project to widen Main Street. He gets it wider by a seventh of an inch every single year, sinking the majority of his expenses into his 'company'. Private infrastructure investments, you gotta love em’.</p>
		
		<p id="C2S3P3" class="content">Anyway, the libertarian mayor had ripped out fourteen of the fifteen parking meters (Which were being established to raise funds for all sorts of utopian pipe dreams like lightspeed trains and coordinated drone flights that deliver custom local beers to the denizens… and a music venue made entirely of LCD screens), except one. The meter on top of Strawriver Hill. Mainly, because he liked it. It was a phallic symbol to compensate for his self established lacking manhood, it cast a shadow over a large portion of the block. It made him feel funny in the groin in a good way every single time he thought about it. The libertarian mayor conceded also to allowing it to function, just so he didn’t have to think of it as a limp, useless, stick.</p>
		
		<p id="C2S3P4" class="content">An elderly citizen with a cane slowly stepped towards the meter sometime around noon. Below it has a sign clearly stating ‘Silver Change Only’. He scoffed. “Silver change? You’ve got to be joking, you think those cheap liberals in Washington D.C. have the guts to put silver into these damn tin buttons!” He started loading it with pennies. He had a whole jar full of them. They were so cumbersome that they practically snapped his cane while being carried. It was now 1 AM. Sgt. Face approached the man on his way back to the station. He somehow convinced the old man to come into the back of his squadcar after they spoke about the military, fishing, patriotism, and how the new apple pies in the store are made with that 'fake crap'. Rather than what they used to be made of, whatever it was, if really anything different. He brought him back to the Cherry Hill Retirement Community – somewhere around 4 AM (the old man kept rambling, and rambling, and rambling). This is the assisted living facility in which he had presided.</p>
		
		<p id="C2S3P5" class="content">After escorting the old man to the front door on this placid night, he noticed the knob was stuck. He turned it once, it was not working. He jimmied it some more, it was still having problems. He knocked a few times… Nothing. This was odd as the facility had a 24/7 lobby. He then radio’d it in. They tried to get in contact with the people working inside but to no avail. Something was amiss, he brought the old man back to the squadcar, ignoring his protests. He turned on the old red and blue. Light cycled across the side of the building in cones. He then produced his gun. He tried kicking down the door. Every single time he tried to budge it, it’d budge back. That was until he shot the door until he could bust a hole in it with his foot. This caused it to crumble. He fell to the side, swinging the pieces of the door caught on his foot with him. The reason why he wasn’t able to get in easily was because it was barricaded with a wall of dismembered nurses. The nurses came tumbling out in piles so intermixed it was indistinguishable which limb went into which socket.</p>
		
		<p id="C2S3P6" class="content">He got up, dusted himself off, and proceeded with extreme caution. Inside he could hear the distinct sound of the buzzing flies and the smell of decaying flesh. The walls were splattered with blood and the floors were smushed with guts. Door by door he noticed no end to the destruction. Residents were either AWOL or dead until he got to room 138 – Barbara Daisy. He knocks on the door. He gets a response of a quiet, timid, old lady trying to hush her own terror. “Just putting on some makeup, I’ll be out in a second.”</p>
		
		<p id="C2S3" class="sectionend">~</p>
		
		<p id="C2S4P1" class="content">Maria went to Bag’n’Save. It was a small local grocery store. She was on a typical grocery store trip. There were 10 aisles at Bag’n’Save. They were also numbered differently on both ends. Like, for example, if you were at Aisle 1 (bread, beer, pizza) the other end of the aisle would be 2 (pizza, beer, bread). It was strange though because one side was: 1-3-5-7-9; the other side was: 2-4-7-8-10. Which was impossible - Aisle 5 was Aisle 7 on one end, and Aisle 6 did not seem to exist. With Aisle 7 being on both ends, well, she had to find out what was down there. Aisle 7 was party supplies, instant pancakes, and chips; in that order on both ends. She came up Aisle 1-2 (the soda, juice, and condiments aisle) and then went down from one end of Aisle 7 to the other.</p>
		
		<p id="C2S4P2" class="content">She realized, strangely, that after getting across the middle, the item assortment on both sides was symmetrical. It was the international foods aisle so that meant she had beans at the beginning and beans at the end, pasta after that and pasta right before the end, and so forth. When she got to the end of the aisle, she ended up coming out of the end she entered. She then turned around one eighty and went up it again, she somehow ended up on the exact same side she entered when she got to the other side, again. She took Aisle 2-1 down to the other end. She took that end’s 7 up. What she learned soon enough, was that Aisle 7 from that end was completely identical to Aisle 7 from the other. The only difference was that she ended up on the opposite end (the same she had entered). She spun one eighty, went up again, and history repeated. Something was clearly amiss. Appearing out the same two aisles twice each while she was pushing a full cart, with everything from tomatoes and salami to walnuts and hot sauce, then examining the marquees for minutes at a time, she must have looked crazy. Maria knew that she wasn’t crazy and, as she thought to herself, “Who knows better than me?”</p>
		
		<p id="C2S4P3" class="content">Well, that left one question unanswered: what happens when she goes down Aisle 5? Does she come out one of the Aisle 7’s? I mean, would she find Aisle 6 on the other side? There was only one way to find out… The first thing she noticed about Aisle 5 was the marquee. All it said was ‘Novelties’. She mediated to herself for a moment on what that even means. The second thing she noticed was that, with the other aisles, she could see all the way to the back of the store. When she looked down Aisle 5 she basically saw an aisle too far to end. No mist, no haze, no obstructions; just went beyond what she could see.</p>
		
		<p id="C2S4P4" class="content">Another thing she noticed was that the people down the aisle were frozen in some kind of static routine. They were doing repetitive tasks uninterrupted by the world surrounding. The final thing she noticed is that she couldn’t see their faces at any angle. She decided to rub her shoulder against a woman to the left of her as she passed. Just to gauge the reaction. The woman, dressed in a black business dress with straw blond hair, did not react at all. I mean, her physical body could be felt but she didn’t seem to notice anything. Maria continued down the aisle. She began to see that the items on both sides of the aisle look like actual items, but really - on closer inspection -  the labels lack any kind of text. There were no markings. The logos seemed to be blurry and indistinguishable. Like, even from the closest distance, it was like looking at them from across a large field. She then continued to walk down her path with the tires of the increasingly disrepaired cart making a screech that felt like it was cutting through her spine. She went deeper and noticed that she didn’t feel any deeper than she was before.</p>
		
		<p id="C2S4P5" class="content">After what seemed like twenty minutes she decided to ‘accidentally’ bump into a faceless old man with paintbrush thin hair, a gray business shirt, and khakis. He didn’t respond either. I mean, like, not at all. He didn’t budge, didn’t move, didn’t stop inspecting the nutritional contents of the can in his hand. She began continually slamming the cart into his hip and… it was like… there was no recoil, no pain, no kickback at all, but the cart stopped on impact. He did not budge through it at all. She screamed, she cursed, she spat in his direction, and he didn’t react. She pressed on further, realizing that the panorama was still the same. The literally faceless customers were even the same people. The shapes, sizes, and essences of the items were the same. The light fixtures overhead seemed the same length at the same spots. She felt as if she was going to nowhere until… she hit a sign.</p>
		
		<p id="C2S4P6" class="content">It was on the right, laminated, marked with a fluorescent green marker. This usually was meant to indicate a special sign or sale. Instead it read ‘Point of No Return’. She knew, she could feel it in her nerves, that if she turned around she would be at the entrance of the aisle. However, she also feared that, if she would have turned back, this sign would have disappeared. So, she treaded on further, taking the path less traveled. The panorama continued exactly as it was. The lighting in the store did not change, she had no concept of day and night anymore, but the sound slowly filtered away. So gradually she didn't notice. Yes, those terrible ‘This Was The Nineties’ hits just vanished completely. One positive of this terrifying situation. She turned around to look over her shoulder, in frustration now… She saw herself looking forward from a distance. She then tried to turn her cart the way she came… the aisle was too thin. The cart couldn’t make it. So, she either chased this reflection or abandoned her cart – But she could not abandon the cart. It took her twenty minutes to find the deli cheesecake with strawberry yogurt fillings she liked, the one hidden away, the one that she can only seem to find every seventh or eighth attempt at looking, the one none of the employees can locate, that she may never find again. She pressed on once again, there were obviously more prescient matters there than escape.</p>

		<p id="C2S5P1" class="content">Everywhere there, every time you saw a concrete slant downward rightways it was closer than a taller concrete slant upward leftways that was closer than an even taller concrete slant downward rightways; This was a city of sawteeth. The sawteeth were always still but could sustain motion simply by the fact the rest of the city was always moving. Between these symmetrical, right angled, enclosures was always pastoral patches. All of which to gave the illusion that the city was more than a mechanical device. These trees were planted, they were just as synthetic as the cement mixtures being poured behind every orange cone. Everything that was here a century ago was buried. William Smirthy was one of those plants. Except in human form. There was nothing natural about him. No matter how many organic non-GMO apricots he had eaten in his lifetime. He was sitting in a half-outdoor cafe. He was, inside, across from the parasols and the glass divider marked ‘Le Haricot Fumant’. He was across the table from a very bad man who’s back was to the vibrant cityscape.</p>
		
		<p id="C2S5P2" class="content">The man placed his bag on the table and said “There’s a compact disc hidden inside...”</p>
		
		<p id="C2S5P3" class="content">"A what!" Smirthy said almost spitting out his surprisingly unsweetened black coffee.</p>
		
		<p id="C2S5P4" class="content">"A Fuckin' CD!"</p>
		
		<p id="C2S5P5" class="content">“Sorry, I don’t know what that is.” He stated nervously, shaking with the coffee in his hand and spilling it over the sides of his cup. He was a young yuppie, software consultant, seven figure wage (five figures by the standards of here in Gentrifiedville). He was dressed exactly as you would imagine. “I… I don’t know what a 'C-D' is.”</p>
		
		<p id="C2S5P6" class="content">“A god damn plastic disc!” Screamed the bad man which made him look even more out of place than his biker get-up did. “Like one you play your goddamned hippie folk mixes on! You put it in the slot and...”</p>
		
		<p id="C2S5P7" class="content">“….Oh, like a Bluray for music!” He said with a pained tear that simply blended in with the nervous sweat. “You’re not going to hurt her, are you?”</p>
		
		<p id="C2S5P8" class="content">“I’m not going to do anything… Sir… I’m simply the messenger for worse people. The instructions are on the cover. Just plug it into your laptop and listen… ok?” Said the bad biker man before jumping out of his seat, taking a chug from the salt shaker (odd…), and then storming out. The people in the background who populated this fairly crowded establishment were too mellowed out to notice anything amiss. He then began sifting through the bag. It was buried in a pile of endless discarded papers. It was marked on the front ‘You have 24 hours. Listen to me.’. He took only a second to breathe and then threw his phone onto the laminated wooden table. He gasped… “This CD thing is wider than my phone!”</p>
		
		<p id="C2S5P9" class="content">“There’s no way.” William thought to himself. “This is an iPhone! iPhones do everything!” He then threw the phone to the side and panicked. “If my iPhone fails me, I’m fucked!” He pulled out his tablet. Well, it was about the width of this plastic archaic device. However, none of the slots were big enough to fit it in. He then tried to crunch it under the case of his tablet… ending up chipping off the edge. He said into his tablet's microphone "Read Companion Disc!" it just opened a search with these words in response. He assumed the data loss was arbitrary or… how did his professors state it, ‘deprecated’? “Or, was it redundant.” He shook his head. “No, it was deprecated.” The fact he only got stoned and hit on loose women during his classes, and downloaded pre-finished tests online, became abundantly clear. “Ok… so think… think… Wait, it’s no longer cool but...”  He then began looking around the cafe suspiciously to ensure nobody would see him pulling out one of these: A laptop. He was ashamed even to own one. Yes, his face turned red but his wife’s life was on the line so he had to stomach the humiliation, no matter how difficult.</p>
		
		<p id="C2S5P10" class="content">He looked at every inch of the laptop. Trying to draw from his subconscious memory what an optical drive looked like. He could of swore his grandparent’s computer had one. Yet, his laptop didn’t, he threw it to the ground and flew out to the bustling streets. He ran through heavy traffic with disc in hand; multiple near fatalities. He ignored the light changes, tripped over a bicycle delivery guy, and bumped his head on a sign. He remembered that some drugstore kiosks allowed you to load CDs for pictures. "Maybe they'd work for sound", he thought. But every one he tried was digital and asked for a cloud account password. He asked everyone behind the counters, and they said they threw out the old kiosks because “Nobody uses CDs anymore”. He looked for computer shops – but they weren’t there. The last Best Buy in the city to not go out of business was operated out of a building that would be bullied in school by a telephone booth. It was closed.</p>
		
		<p id="C2S5P11" class="content">The sun set, the CD went unread, he lost hope because nobody in this part of the city had a laptop with an optical drive. No car driver had one in his or her car. No laptop being sold would have one. He cried at the corner until an old homeless man approached him. Usually he reviled the homeless but he needed a friend. The homeless man told him that he was an antique computer parts collector. He brought him to a cove hidden deep under a train bridge, and he ended up finding a stack of old laptops with power chargers that worked, and had optical drives (they were plugging into a light pole which oddly had an outlet). He tried the disc on each one… it kept giving him some disc read errors. In his confusion, he took the laptops threw them into the homeless man’s shopping cart, and rudely departed. The homeless man cursed and insulted him on the way out. Labeling him, fairly, a thief.</p>
		
		<p id="C2S5P12" class="content">He dropped each laptop onto the desk of a late closing hobbyshop. The place is poorly lit, the items arranged on generic black felt shelves, and the only employee looked to be about seventeen or eighteen. The employee wore a purple shirt with yellow stitching and the company logo. Best yet, he had thick eyeglasses with the bifocal rectangles. A true nerd beacon to William. This was not a computer shop but the kid agreed to look at his CD problem for a handful of hundreds. William paced back and forth practically slipping into an aneurysm. The kid pulled the disc out after a few failed tries. It was intensely scratched. He examined it closely. He then popped up from his swivel leather chair with a eureka moment. “Sir, I think your problem is here.” He said pointing to a chipped off portion of the CD. “Do you have a backup?” Of course, the answer was no. And his heart was going like mad and no he said no I don’t no.</p>
