		<p id="C1" class="chapterhead">Chapter 1: Oh, My Golly!</p>

		<p id="C1S1P1" class="content">Barbara Daisy heard a knock on her door. She was caught off guard. It was Saturday, all the doctor’s offices were closed. Her daughter always slept in on the weekends. It was too early for a club meeting, and at this point the only nurses working would be sneaking to the storage closet to smoke pot. It seemed impossible that anyone would have been here to disturb her. And, yes, she was greatly disturbed by this. Vague slivers of light bled in through the closed blinds. She could see slightly better than last night, just enough to get to the door on her own. The Gameshow Network was still on, near burnt onto the screen, the images changed so little that it may actually be possible that they likely would soon be. It took her twenty five minutes to get out from under the covers. It took maybe thirteen or fourteen more to get presentable (or at least to a standard of presentability adjusted to her dismal state of self). It took ten more to get to the door. During this entire process, the knocking did not cease. The neighboring residents all went into deeper hiding in response. They were terrified by knocking, especially on weekend mornings, as it was almost always bad news. When she opened the door she saw a man with tusk-white teeth, and a yellow suit. He was supernaturally kempt. In fact, he looked like King Midas post-masturbation.</p>
		
		<p id="C1S1P2" class="content">“Young man, why are you disturbing me on this Saturday morning? I have my rights!” She inquired, aggressively. “No soliciting!”</p>
		
		<p id="C1S1P3" class="content">The Midas Man responded “I’m not a salesman. Your daughter sent me, I’m a doctor.”</p>
		
		<p id="C1S1P4" class="content">She thought to herself “Oh, my golly!” Her facial expression showcased her disdain for doctors in a way Stevie Wonder could read, no matter how hard she tried to conceal it.</p>
		
		<p id="C1S1P5" class="content">“It’s ok, ma’am, I have the cure.” He pulled out a plastic container from his side pocket. The container was actually two containers. On the outside a hard plastic shell the same width, and twice the thickness, of an Altoids can. The inside container was a slightly tinted suspended oblong cuboid. Inside the cuboid was, fastened in cloth, a purple, literally smoking, pill. “This is Plecexadril. It’s a magic drug that cures everything!” </p>

		<p id="C1S1P6" class="content">“Everything?” Barbara skepticized while adjusting her plastic industrial grade glasses. “Did Julia really send you?”</p>
		
		<p id="C1S1P7" class="content">The Midas man stuck his hand in his suit’s inner breast. From there, a full sized clipboard, with a couple centimeters of documents crammed in it, was somehow produced. “You know this...” He asked while squeezing the clipboard with his right hand and pointing to the top of the first document with his extended, unusually long, sinistral index finger. At the top was a blue insignia with a cross and a skyscraper. “...OFFICIAL seal?”</p>
		
		<p id="C1S1P8" class="content">“That’s my insurance!” She stated with some semblance legitimate astonishment. “Are you here to take my money!”</p>
		
		<p id="C1S1P9" class="content">“No, Barb. Just some evidence of my genuineness. How else would I have this without your daughter’s knowledge? She signed the insurance papers. She’s the one who pays my check. Now, Seeing as I work for your provider, I can get you this for free. It’s one dose, one shot, and it will cure everything.”</p>
		
		<p id="C1S1P10" class="content">“Everything? You mean my cataracts?” He nodded. “My arthritis?” He nodded again. “My colon issues?”</p>
		
		<p id="C1S1P11" class="content">“Ma’am, everything. This tiny, itty-bitty, medical miracle cures every illness: every bacteria, every virus, every variety cancer; it even heals bones, psychological ailments... some say it even cures debt! You only have to take it once and your insurance covers ALL expenses! Not a penny out of your pocket! Guaranteed!” The man claimed. Her eyes were positively glowing in response. It felt like it was the greatest moment of her life. He wrapped his fist around the container and extended it forward. She, very lethargically, extended her own, and then spun her wrist to where her fingernails were facing upward. He stared square into her eyes with fatherly warmth, the kind she hadn’t felt since early youth, and then nodded. She unclasped her fingers and the pillbox dropped into her open palm.</p>

		<p id="C1S2P1" class="content">Music journalists don't often end up face down in the river – until a Beyonce single comes out. Then, they have to run for the hills! There has been a string (more like a skein) of murders involving music reviewers who chose to give her releases anything but a perfect score. Beyonce has just released her latest chart topping hit “Hot Royale Woman”... and it’s terrible. Absolutely horrendous. In fact, if this narrator here existed in this world, I’d probably be having a pitchfork driven through my chest and my face melted off via torch for these words. Sorry for breaking the fourth wall, it’s a sign of a hack writer. I’m trying to avoid those kind of cheap, outdated, postmodern gimmicks. [ I ] will from now on. Anyway, they dress in neon sunglasses, and wear orange and pink tasseled denim jackets with pop-star patches and purple in-striped linings. Also they usually shave their heads bald so they can wear interchangeable wigs of all the colors of the rainbow. The guns they carry around are stylish as Hell, too. They are made of refined steel bodies embossed in 24k gold. They pay for all of this by allowing sponsors to engrave their logos in them everywhere. That way, when a bit of footage of them blasting away a music reviewer’s children, in broad daylight, on the way back from school, appears on the news, the engravers have saved themselves forty-five to fifty-six percent on advertising. (Note From the Author: tbf, this only happened 3 times. Consider it an illustrative example).</p>
		
		<p id="C1S2P2" class="content">The gang (as they are legalistically considered) consists of mostly high-school seniors and juniors, middle class, predominately female, mostly Caucasian, and more often then not brace-faced. Yet they are one of the most efficient, well managed, criminal networks in the world. Considered to be more deadly than MS13 and, unlike the Juggalo Army, they cannot be halted with a clever placement of a few tongue-tempting open sockets (which is how the FBI currently handles population control in response of the Juggalo scourge). They do not sell drugs or illicit any black market product. They even file their taxes accurately. They were formed solely with the purpose of defending Beyonce from the emotional trauma (their emotional trauma, not hers. They ignore her condemnations.) of even a poorly worded, unenthusiastic, good review. And don’t think not reviewing Beyonce is a way out, or even retiring from the game. They’ll hunt you down. That’s an bigger insult than the most incendiary review. They know no mercy.</p>
		
		<p id="C1S2P3" class="content">That’s why Hipster extraordinaire, Nevan Plowme, has decided to do something about it. They have already bombarded Hipsforque HQ while he was working, leaving his face disfigured. This was after he had written in his last Beyonce album review ‘...clearly phoning it in at this point. Hell, if they built a fiber cable the circumference of the Hadron Collider, it wouldn’t have enough bandwidth to transport the sheer mass of cynicism that made this schlockorama possible. I am actually impressed by Beyonce’s overly ambitious disinterest. There’s plenty of up and coming underground alt-pop artists who could use a little of that limelight. Ones who still actually care. She’s on autopilot. Will her star ever fade? 8.1/10’. One day hopped onto his Harley and decided to start traveling the land looking for the biggest, baddest, hipsters to form a posse. The kind that chew the glass Mason jars of their deconstructed craft vegan lasagna with their gums just to feel the pain. Hell, the kind that will subject themselves to listen to a Chris Cornell marathon (specifically Post-Soundgarden) on a bet, and somehow walk out alive. Yes, he left the comforts of Williamsburg, and has been traveling the anarchic wilderness of the United States of America from Austin to Minneapolis all the way to Portland. Trying to find the right lawmen to tame this Twitter-inspired desert cemetery of modernity. He’s now living the dream of every Hipster;  he’s starring in an ironic subversive western of his very own.</p>

		<p id="C1S3P1" class="content">The contents of the laundry room were invisible at first. A switch was then flipped. The laundry room was then visibly squirming with cockroaches. This happened every time. The laundry room itself looked like a shower from a top secret medical experiment camp in a jungle for a black book military excursion. A drain was oddly juxtaposed in the middle of the chipped floor constructed of granite tiles bound by yellowing plaster. There were specs shining from littered glass shards, galore. Furthermore, the walls were conspicuously singed and clearly painted in layers over layers of wallpaper. The light arrhythmically flickered on occasion. Lita Tincture walked in with tall hard leather boots that have her baggy gym pants rolled into them. Her stuffed long sleeve sweater was rolled into her heavy-duty gloves. A gas mask was fastened to her turtleneck. In her left hand she had an electric zapper; one of those that looked like an air traffic controller's baton with metal grating and a luminous turquoise center. It was the kind which sparks when the metal grating on the outside comes in contact with anything. In the other hand she had a insecticide spray so toxic, it would R. Kelly wince. She instantly began spraying and zapping and stomping with reckless abandon.</p>
		
		<p id="C1S3P2" class="content">The amassed cockroaches went from the population of Tokyo to the median income of Detroit within moments. Whatever cockroaches were left alive were forced into exile. She got to the nineteen-fifties model coin-pay washing machines in the back. There were four. She observed that the first three were out of order. Only one had sign marking it a ‘FUCKING Borkd peese of SHETT 8( !!’. Another had fallen over flowing water into the drain. Another has been broken for five presidencies, according to legend. She opened the fourth and it was already in use. It appeared to only have a giant blue blanket with conspicuous yellow, brown, white, and red stains. The blanket was crawling with small brown dots. Luckily, beside her, one of the laundry machines had a full pressure cooker containing rotten half eaten lambchops (mostly by the insects) smothered in mold-cultivating barbecue sauce on top of it. From her pocket she pulled out an unused oil rag (trust me, she always needed one handy) so she could wipe off the plastic tongs. She lifted up the blanket with them. She threw the blanket to the ground as the little buggies crawled every which way. “Only one way to deal with bedbugs. “ she thought to herself.</p>
		
		<p id="C1S3P3" class="content">She then wiped a pile of cockroach corpses off a small side table (littered with trashy period piece erotica), and grabbed a laminated sign underneath which stated ‘Extermination In Progress’. No, she was not the exterminator, but the rental agency had bribed the inspectors to continually deem such a service unnecessary. Oh yeah, also, three members of the family that manages the place are members of the municipal rental board. All of the equipment she’s been using is ‘communal’ equipment which the few decent residents here have chipped in for (‘You break, you pay’).</p>
		 
		<p id="C1S3P4" class="content">From a hidden area under a tarp in the alleyway behind the complex was a long pipe. This pipe was wood-shed-style metal: black-spotted, rusted, and completely charred on the inside. Also under the tarp, was a red gas can containing an elixir so noxious she could prominently smell it through her gas mask. It made her nearly pass out on the first sniff. She then came back to the laundry room. She placed the pipe, awkwardly, through the singular barred window from the outside. She then poured the liquid through the pipe until it was dripping onto the floor. It was pitch black, gravy-like in consistency, and bubbling. She then took a lighter from her right pocket and flicked it on; only holding it an inch away from the pipe, a fireball exploded through like a shotgun blast. This sent the abundance of asbestos, already charred lead paint chips, and cockroach corpses inside aflame. It was hot enough to melt the glass on the syringes hidden in the cracks. She kept doing this until everything not metal (apart from the fireproof walls) was burnt or melted away. Years ago, somebody (accidentally) learned that this place used to be a fire-proof jail (fire started on the outside doesn’t enter and vice versa) so this became a routine. It was overkill for the bedbugs.</p>
		
		<p id="C1S3P5" class="content">The owner of the blanket saw what was going on. She was the hunchbacked old lady with a patchy white mustache, seventy-six percent missing teeth, and arms covered in tracks revealed by the scanty, mustard-stained, Victoria Secret nightie she always wore. She approached Lita and began bitching. Lita threatened to tell the complex about her and she immediately conceded – realizing that being a bedbug spreader made you a modern leper in this community. Right before the flames burnt everything to darkness, Lita smacked herself in the head and threw all of her outer clothing (around her street clothes) into the flames to be burnt, too. Close one. After she was done, she wiped the cinder, ash, and general muck off of all surfaces. She then finally retrieved her laundry and threw it in the only working machine (hoping it was still working). The moment she started the machine a mysterious dark brown tide began flooding upward from the drain in the middle of the floor. It was smelly and full of little smidgens of enigmatic crud of various mushiness. It rose enough to short the electricity, seep into the machine, and destroy the load. But at least the rent was reasonable.</p>

		<p id="C1S4P1" class="content">Barbara Daisy woke up one morning at 2 AM. She always gave up going back to sleep when waking up this early. After all, it allowed her some cherished, rare, time to herself. The TV was on GSN, but it was infomercials this time. The infomercials looked exactly like the gameshows (not just to her, but to anybody, but especially to her). So, she rolled out of bed the best she could, grabbed her walker, and began to walk to her mini-, and only, bathroom. She usually dreaded going to the bathroom, because it was a struggle to fit her walker in there. A situation compounded by her colon issues. She arrived at her bathroom at 3:45 AM (direct path from the bed). She opened the mirror cabinet and turned on the lights (in that order). Inside the mirror cabinet was a wide array of cosmetic products, some with unreasonable prices in proportion to her social security takeaway, and all of which kept prim and proper. She arranged her makeup like it was 1970s punch cards in a Pentagon computer at the height of the Cold War. Every single piece was in reach and, because of her failing eyesight, she had to arrange a system based off of memory. She spent countless hours assembling this system by herself, the rare moments she could. Somehow formulating it (treating the makeup as contraband) without anyone knowing. She began to collect the makeup that works for her in this moment. She never applied the makeup in the way she imagined looking, but the way that represents how she truly feels, deep in her inner core. The way she cultivated this was, in fact, true art. She had to do everything by feel but it was still perfect. Even though around her mouth it was weirdly sticky, maybe it was mucus, she was just too happy she was actually salivating to keep mind of it. “I can work the makeup around that”, she thought. Then quickly moved outward.</p>
		
		<p id="C1S4P2" class="content">When doing this, she fell into daydreams. She had the chance to relive her entire life moment-by-moment. Like an autobiography filtered through both the bias of her longing for a time that never existed, and her failing memory. She was reliving her first kiss. She applied a bold strawberry red glossy tone. Like technicolor film bold. Even though the lipstick she wore that day was walnut brown. She lived in the city in an age where the city looked like the small rural communities of today. Sure, the buildings were square and tall, but the pace was slower. The cars puttered, the crime was more violent but less murderous, and there was no surveillance. Horrible things happened but she was suppressing them. This is how old Pittsburgh looked in her mind. Her family seemed weirdly Waltonesc. Her dress looked like a big dish rag. Her hair was in twin braids.  This was only one step down the slippery slope of lost innocence. She remember the name of the boy, Tommy Borsand.</p>
		
		<p id="C1S4P3" class="content">His dad drove the bread truck, community pillar. Tommy was a slightly tallish, awkward, overly polite gentleman with limbs as thin as a haythistle. His hair was between blond and brown, kind of dirty no matter how hard he tried to clean it. He was a class clown, a troublemaker (mischievous but not criminal), yet always stuck up for the smaller kids. He was incapable of being a bully, and he took being bullied with a pearly smile. They danced, and laughed, under the wax fake-gold chandelier. Everyone was in blue and green tuxedos and gowns. The punch was emptied, the fun was over. It was right as they were leaving to walk home. He kissed her on impulse, wrapped up in the excitement, he didn’t know what he was doing, but he didn’t do too much. He apologized but she smiled, and gave him a tight hug. She fondly remembered the warmth that night gave her. That was the inspiration that she needed. She balanced the pigments perfectly, just as in her dreams, and shut the cabinet… She looked in the mirror and, around her mouth, she realized something suspicious. “I don’t remembering putting on so much rose pigment...” She then squinted, focusing her sight. Through the age-defying makeup was a thick crimson shade. She gasped, revealing her teeth covered in clumped purple paste crystals. Suddenly, the sound of her toilet choking was heard, as the water began to spill over the lid. In the middle of the filling bowl was a severed head, face down. The water started seeping up to her ankles. She almost had the time to panic but was immediately distracted by two very strong pigments circulating through her room outside the bathroom – red and blue – shining through the blinds.</p>

		<p id="C1S5P1" class="content">Studcutt just felt like cut-cutt. He woke up from the train tracks in the morning. He saw then the trees were dead around him, the forest was gone. The sky was clear, and cold, but clouds were gathering again. He started to fear that snow was coming down soon. Brisk turned to freezing, it felt he had icesickles in his veins. This dulled the physical pain but the sting of unhealing emotional gashes raged on. He pulled himself up by the twisted railing beside him; he felt a slight pinch. It sliced his palm down the middle. He looked down, over the railing, where the ground was burnt black. The bodies that are left intact have been wrapped in black bags. The ambulances looked like maggots, the paramedics looked like lice. He felt a disdain for them but didn’t know why; these were life-savers… Or at least giving the fallen some kind of dignity. The clouds began to form heavily. He saw a vision in the sky – an emerald sword – the same shade as lady liberty. It descended, crashing through the shattering clouds (like glass), and splitting a mountain open at it’s top. The mountain started erupting. The eruption was not lava, it was iridescent sparkles that burnt his eyes from a distance. He started growing two oblong tilted halos of stars around his head that made him feel dizzy. He lost his balance, stumbled over the railing, and began to roll down the dirt. His bloodied, naked, body began to collect mudballs on the way down. He looked like a rock monster when he had landed. His vision was dazed. The world was a blur. He saw himself being loaded onto a stretcher. Before he tried to kill himself he devoted his life to the more quiet moments. Well, he thought it was harmless, but that’s the last time he reads Kafka in the dark. The ambulance whirred away. He saw the sword again in his dreams. After he pieced the puzzle together, it was not really a sword. It was something different it was... Convergence Point, where Fate Dr. meets Cataclysm Ave; 6756 Fate Dr. He knew he must find it, even it kills him.</p>
